Welcome to ARKA 3js Assignment! This project showcases an interactive scene using three.js, allowing users to draw polygons, duplicate them, and reset the scene. Simply open index.html in your web browser to start. Click to add vertices and create polygons, finalize them with the "Complete" button, duplicate the last drawn polygon with "Copy", or clear the scene with "Reset". The scene includes a canvas texture grid and uses basic HTML/CSS for button UI. Contributions are welcome via pull requests. This project is licensed under the MIT License. Happy exploring and creating in 3D!
